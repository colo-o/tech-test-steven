### Instructions

Clone our repository

Make sure you have installed

- Node
- NPM / Yarn

Run:

### `yarn install`

Install dependencies

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn api`
